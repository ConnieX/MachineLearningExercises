# MachineLearningExercises
 My exercises of machine learning from the beginning of master's studies (2021). Please note these codes may not run due to the recent changes of keras and tensorflow libraries. I am planning upgrading them.

Exercises were taken from book Deep Learning with Python by Fran√ßois Chollet.
